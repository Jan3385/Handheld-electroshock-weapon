## 10/21/2025 - Schematic, README and a sketch  

I made a little sketch of how would I like the taser to look like at the end with a few squares to keep oriented what will be where

Also made a schematic just to know how to wire everything together
(first time using KiCad lol)

And finally made a little README.md which I will expand later when I create the 3D model and such  

## 10/22/2025 6 PM - making CAD files  

Made some CAD files to test if everything fits etc. I will print them out and change them after that to hopefully have working stl files

I will be making them out of PLA now but the final product will be made most likely from ASA
  

## 10/22/2025 9 PM - Test assembly on PLA  

Assembeled the main parts together to see what needs to be changed with the 3D model. The PLA test model was absolutely put to the test to see what sticks and what doesnt. Changed the 3D model up a bit and made a semi-final version. I will have to make the top of the taser and a few more changes but other than that the casing should be done

## 10/23/2025 - Final(?) model   

Carefully inspected the PLA version to find anything that cracked, failed or just didnt fit I made the probably final model for the taser

The taser is made from 3 different parts that fit together. The frame, battery cover and top.

I will print the cover out of ASA (my first printing with it and I dont have an enclosed printer so its gonna be a lot of trial and error), the frame from PETG and the top either from PETG or ASA depending on how well the cover prints from ASA.

I am choosing the ASA due to its lack of elasticity and strength for the cover and the PETG since its more elastics and allows some parts a bit of play and hopefully manages to protect the print if it falls  

## 10/25/2025 - Pre-Assembly  

I 3D printed all the parts and cleaned them up like removing supports, fixing defects etc. It was my first time printing ASA and I dont even have a 3D printer enclosure so my taser head started cracking and I melted it at some parts to fuse it back together. Looking back I would probably print the top using PETG instead of ASA. I also made electrodes for the top and soldered them to wires that will go on the output of a high voltage pulse generator

Next step is soldering the electronics together and that will probably be the end of this project

If somebody is interested the total print time for all parts was around the 5-6 hour mark  

## 10/27/2025 3 PM - Made the project IRL  

I assembled the 3D printed parts and soldered the electronics.
It was kinda hard to solder everything while partly inside the case but I managed to do so

When building this I recommend making the case out of PETG and the rest from ASA or a different material that doesnt bend too much. I also recommend making sure that the electronics inside are well isolated as I did not and when the electrodes were blocked it struck my LED inside the case and the LED stopped working (everything else works). Gonna finish up my project next like making BOM.csv etc

Also when printing ASA remember to use a hotbox. I did not have one sadly avalible and some cracks started to form on my 3D print which I had to patch myself with a soldering iron  

## 10/27/2025 4 PM - Finished the README, added BOM etc  

Probably finished this project by making the final BOM and completing the README

Making this has been fun and the project ended up being shockingly cheap
